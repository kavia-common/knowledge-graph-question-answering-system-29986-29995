# Notes:
# - For local/dev Neo4j: use bolt://localhost:7687
# - For Neo4j Aura or DNS-SRV-enabled endpoints: prefer neo4j://<host>:7687
#   The neo4j scheme enables driver-side routing and resolves A/AAAA/SRV records.
# - If you face "Cannot resolve address <host>:7687", verify:
#   1. Correct host (from Neo4j console)
#   2. Your environment can resolve DNS for that host (try nslookup/ping)
#   3. Outbound network access is allowed (firewall/proxy)
#   4. Try switching to neo4j:// scheme instead of bolt://
